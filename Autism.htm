                <li> not responding to their name.</li>
                <li> avoiding eye contact.
                </li>
                <li> not smiling when you smile at them.
                </li>

                </li>
                <li> repetitive movements, such as flapping their hands, flicking their fingers or rocking their body.
                </li>
                <li>All people with autism have abnormal functioning in three core areas of development:
                    <ol>
                        <li>social interaction</li>
                        <li>verbal and nonverbal communication</li>
                        <li>the presence of repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior, interests, activities</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by
                    challenges with
                    social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers
                    for Disease
                    Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 44 children in the United States today.</p>
                <p>
                    No cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. The goal
                    of treatment is
                    to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing autism spectrum disorder symptoms and
                    supporting
                    development and learning.
                </p>
            </UL>
            <li>Behavioral Management Therapy for Autism</li>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Behavior management therapy tries to reinforce wanted behaviors and reduce unwanted behaviors. It
                    also suggests what
                    caregivers can do before, during, after, and between episodes of problem behaviors.
                    Behavioral therapy is often based on applied behavior analysis (ABA), a widely accepted approach
                    that tracks a
                    child's progress in improving his or her skills.</p>
                <p>Different types of ABA commonly used to treat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include:</p>
                <li> Positive Behavioral and Support (PBS). PBS aims to figure out why a child does a particular problem
                    behavior. It
                    works to change the environment, teach skills, and make other changes that make a correct behavior
                    more positive for
                    the child. This encourages the child to behave more appropriately.
                </li>
                <li> Pivotal Response Training (PRT). PRT takes place in the child's everyday environment. Its goal is
                    to improve a few
                    "pivotal" skills, such as motivation and taking initiative to communicate. These help the child to
                    learn many other
                    skills and deal with many situations.
                </li>
                <li> Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI). EIBI provides individualized, behavioral
                    instruction to very young
                    children with ASD. It requires a large time commitment and provides one-on-one or small-group
                    instruction.
                </li>
                <li> Discrete Trial Teaching (DTT). DTT teaches skills in a controlled, step-by-step way. The teacher
                    uses positive
                    feedback to encourage the child to use new skills.
                    Keep in mind that other behavioral therapies, beyond ABA, may also be effective for people with ASD.
                    Talk to your
                    health care provider about the best options for your child.</li>

            </ul>
            <li> Behavior Therapy for Autism</li>
            <p>Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
                Together, the therapist, the person with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and/or the parents come up with
                specific
                goals for the course of therapy. Throughout the sessions, the person with autism learns to identify and
                change
                thoughts that lead to problem feelings or behaviors in particular situations.1,2
                Cognitive behavior therapy is structured into specific phases of treatment. However, it is also
                individualized to
                patients' strengths and weaknesses. Research shows that this therapy helps people with some types of ASD
                deal with
                anxiety. It can also help some people with autism cope with social situations and better recognize
                emotions.
            </p>

            <li>Early Intervention for Autism</li>
            <ul>
                <p>Research shows that early diagnosis of and interventions for autism are more likely to have major
                    long-term positive
                    effects on symptoms and later skills.1,2,3,4,5 Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can sometimes be
                    diagnosed in children
                    before they are 2 years of age. Some children with ASD whose development seems typical up to that
                    point begin to
                    regress just before or sometime during age 2 years.6</p>
                <p>Early intervention programs often include:</p>
                <li> Family training
                </li>
                <li> Speech therapy
                </li>
                <li> Hearing impairment services
                </li>
                <li> Physical therapy
                </li>
                <li> Nutrition services</li>
                <p>
                    Early interventions occur at or before preschool age, as early as 2 or 3 years of age. In this
                    period, a young
                    child's brain is still forming,7 meaning it is more "plastic" or changeable than at older ages.
                    Because of this
                    plasticity, treatments have a better chance of being effective in the longer term.6 Early
                    interventions not only
                    give children the best start possible, but also the best chance of developing to their full
                    potential. The sooner a
                    child gets help, the greater the chance for learning and progress. In fact, recent guidelines
                    suggest starting an
                    integrated developmental and behavioral intervention as soon as ASD is diagnosed or seriously
                    suspected.6
                    With early intervention, some children with autism make so much progress that they are no longer on
                    the autism
                    spectrum when they are older. Many of the children who later go off the spectrum have some things in
                    common:3

                </li>
                <li> A higher intelligence quotient (IQ, a measure of thinking ability) than average for a child with
                    autism

            <li>Educational and School-Based Therapies for Autism</li>
            <P>
                Children with autism are guaranteed free, appropriate public education under the federal laws of Public
                Law 108-177:
                Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004), sometimes called "IDEA."
                IDEA ensures that children diagnosed with certain disabilities or conditions, including autism spectrum
                disorder
                (ASD), get free educational services and educational devices to help them to learn as much as they can.
                NICHD-funded researchers have also incorporated communications interventions for children with ASD
                within the
                classroom setting, with successful outcomes. Although the specific interventions used in the study are
                not a
                guaranteed part of IDEA, components from the program could provide an important evidence-based
                foundation for future
                school-based therapies.</P>

            <li>Joint Attention Therapy for Autism</li>

                <p>Research shows that many people with autism have difficulty with joint attention, which is the
                    ability to share
                    focus on an object or area with another person. Examples of joint attention skills include following
                    someone else's
                    gaze or pointed finger to look at something.
                    Joint attention is important to communication and language learning. Joint attention therapy focuses
                    on improving
                </p>
                <p>specific skills related to shared attention,1 such as:</p>
                <li>Pointing</li>
                <li> Showing</li>
                <li>Coordinating looks between a person and an object</li>
                <P>Improvements from such treatments can last for years.

            <li>Medication Treatment for Autism</li>
            <ul>
                <p>Currently, there is no medication that can cure autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or all of its
                    symptoms. But some
                    medications can help treat certain symptoms associated with ASD, especially certain behaviors.
                    NICHD does not endorse or support the use of any medications not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
                    Administration
                    (FDA) for treating symptoms of autism or other conditions.
                    Healthcare providers often use medications to deal with a specific behavior, such as to reduce
                    self-injury or
                    aggression. Minimizing a symptom allows the person with autism to focus on other things, including
                    learning and
                    communication. Research shows that medication is most effective when used in combination with
                    behavioral therapies.1
                    The FDA has approved the use of some antipsychotic drugs, such as risperidone and aripripazole, for
                    treating
                    irritability associated with ASD in children between certain ages.2 Parents should talk with their
                    child's
                    healthcare providers about any medications for children with ASD.
                    Other drugs are often used to help improve symptoms of autism, but they are not approved by the FDA
                    for this
                    specific purpose. Some medications on this list are not approved for those younger than 18 years of
                    age. Please
                    consult the FDA for complete information on the following listed medications.
                    All medications carry risks, some of them serious. Families should work closely with their
                    children's healthcare
                    providers to ensure safe use of any medication.3</p>

                    </li>
                    <li> These drugs seem to cause more minor side effects than do SSRIs. They are sometimes more

            <li>Creating a Medication Plan</li>
            <ul>
                <p>Healthcare providers usually prescribe a medication on a trial basis to see if it helps. Some
                    medications may make
                    symptoms worse at first or take several weeks to work. Your child's healthcare provider may have to
                    try different
                    dosages or different combinations of medications to find the most effective plan.
                    Families, caregivers, and healthcare providers need to work together to make sure that the
                    medication plan is safe
                    and that all medications have some benefit.</p>
                <p>Things to remember about medication:</p>
                <li> Healthcare providers and families should work together to help ensure safe use of medication.
                </li>
                <li> Not every medication helps every person with symptoms of autism.
                </li>
                <li>One person with autism might respond to medications differently than another person with autism or
                    than people who
                    don't have autism.
                </li>
                <li> Some medications have serious risks involved with their use.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li>Nutritional Therapy for Autism</li>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    For a variety of reasons, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may not get the nutrition
                    they need for
                    healthy growth and development.1,2,3,4 Some children with autism will only eat certain foods because
                    of how the
                    foods feel in their mouths. Other times, they might avoid eating foods because they associate them
                    with stomach pain
                    or discomfort. Some children are put on limited diets in hopes of reducing autism symptoms.
                    It is important that parents and caregivers work with a nutrition specialist—such as a registered
                    dietitian—or
                    health care provider to design a meal plan for a person with autism, especially if they want to try
                    a limited diet.
                    Such providers can help to make sure the child is still getting all the nutrients he or she needs to
                    grow into a
                    healthy adult, even while on the special diet.
                    For example, many children with ASD are on gluten-free or casein-free diets. (Gluten and casein are
                    types of
                    proteins found in wheat and milk products, respectively.) Available research data do not support the
                    use of a
                    casein-free diet, a gluten-free diet, or a combined gluten-free, casein-free diet as a primary
                    treatment for
                    individuals with ASD.5</P>
                <h4></h4>Good Nutrition Is Important</h4>
                <P>Research shows that children with autism tend to have thinner bones than children without autism.6
                    Restricting
                    access to bone-building foods, such as dairy products, can make it even harder for their bones to
                    grow strong.
                    Working with a health care provider can help ensure that children who are on special diets still get
                    the
                    bone-building and other nutrients they need.
                    Digestive Problems in ASD
                    Some people with autism also have digestive problems, such as constipation, abdominal (belly) pain,
                    or vomiting.
                    Some research7 suggests that digestive problems occur more often in people with autism than in
                    people without
                    autism, but research is still being done on this topic.5,7 Working with a health care provider can
                    help ensure that
                    a diet does not make digestive problems worse.
                    NICHD and other agencies and organizations will continue research to learn more about how children
                    with autism grow
                    and if they have specific nutritional needs.

            <ul>
                <p>
                    Occupational therapy helps people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do everyday tasks by finding
                    ways to work
                    within and make the most of their needs, abilities, and interests.1
                    An occupational therapist might:</p>
                <li> Find a specially designed computer mouse and keyboard to ease communication</li>
                <li>Teach personal care skills such as getting dressed and eating</li>
                <li>Do many of the same types of activities that physical therapists do</li>

            <ul>
                <p>
                    In parent-mediated therapy, parents learn therapy techniques from professionals and provide specific
                    therapies to
                    their own child. This approach gives children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) consistent
                    reinforcement and
                    training throughout the day. Parents can also conduct some therapies with children who are at risk
                    of autism but are
                    too young to be diagnosed.</p>
                <p>Several types of therapies can be parent-mediated activities, including:</p>
                <li> Joint attention therapy</li>
                <li> Social communication therapy</li>
                <li> Behavioral therapy</li>
                <p>Studies suggest that parent-mediated therapies might be able to improve the child's communication
                    skills and
                    interactions with others.1 Researchers are still collecting evidence on parent-mediated therapies

            <li>Physical Therapy for Autism</li>
            <ul>
                <p>
                    Physical therapy includes activities and exercises that build motor skills and improve strength,
                    posture, and
                    balance.
                    For example, this type of therapy aims to help a child build muscle control and strength so that he
                    or she can play
                    more easily with other children.
                    Problems with movement are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and many children with autism
                    receive physical
                    therapy.1 However, there is not yet solid evidence that particular therapies can improve movement
                    skills in those
                    with autism.2,3

                <p>Social skills training teaches children the skills they need to interact with others. It includes
                    repeating and
                    reinforcing certain desired behaviors.
                    The Children's Friendship Training intervention,1 for instance, helps elementary school-age children
                    improve several
                    social skills:</p>
                <li>Conversation</li>
